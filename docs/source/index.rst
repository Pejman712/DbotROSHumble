Welcome to Dbots's documentation!
===================================

The Dbot, a differential-wheeled robot, is specially designed for autonomous indoor robotics research. It has undergone significant hardware updates. Presently, Dbot features a Velodyne VLP16 LiDAR, a Realsense camera, an Intel Core i7 CPU, and an NVIDIA RTX 2070 GPU. Originally configured for ROS Noetic, Dbot has been recently upgraded to ROS2 Humble. This guide aims to assist students in using and adapting Dbot for their projects.
